- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tldrEllie
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in embedded development, building tools that are simple and straightforward, and deconstructing capitalism.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning rust, how to ferment things, and how to move through the world with more kindness.

- Mostly I keep my projects on my own [personal git server](http://git.cartbeforethe.horse), and at work, of course. This account is for public collaboration.
